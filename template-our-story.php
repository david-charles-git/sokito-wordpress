											<p class="font_size_22 fw400 wc lh120 text_padd_new ulr">It started with a holiday to Hoi An in Vietnam, where, instead of enjoying the famous Cao lầu secret noodles, we were too busy noodling around the local market trying to find a pair of handmade leather brogues. It got us thinking, “if we can have this level of detail and craftsmanship in a brogue, can we have it in a football boot?”, or something like that. We’d had a few drinks, but you get our drift.</p> 
											<p class="font_size_22 fw400 wc lh120 text_padd_new ulr">We took two trips back to Vietnam (for the boots, not the noodles), handed in our P45, and started Sokito. We learned that intelligent software and sustainable-design could change the face of performance football products whilst changing the world.</p>
											<p class="font_size_22 fw400 wc lh120 text_padd_new ulr">Our journey is just getting started.
