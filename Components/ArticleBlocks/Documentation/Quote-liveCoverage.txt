Assests / Information Required :
    Font files in woff and woff2 formats for the dispaly font (Gza) and the body font (Ubivers LT Std) - the style guide claims they are on google fonts but they are not there as far as I can see - additioanlly self hosting fonts is better for GDPR and page speed.

Requiremnts :
    container :
        The max width of the content is as per style guide
        The content is split into two asymemtrical columns on desktop and tablet - title left, quote right
        The content is contained within a single column on mobile - title top, quote bottom
    
    title :
        This will be a h3 tag - the font size and style of a h3 in the style guide is incorrect for this container, therefore I have given it the classes font-large and font-body to make it the given font style of an large body element (see style guide)
        The max width of this container is 420px
        The color of the title is white (#000000)
    
    quote : 
        The Quotation mark will be styled sollowing the h2 sizings but with the body font and a font-weight of normal as this has the closest font style to the design and is colored #000000.
        The Quote is styles like a large body copy element except that is has a light font weight and has an oblique font style - it is also colored green (#48A18A);
        The content is center aligned.
