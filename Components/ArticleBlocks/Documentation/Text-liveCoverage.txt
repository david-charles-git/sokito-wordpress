Assests / Information Required :
    Font files in woff and woff2 formats for the dispaly font (Gza) and the body font (Ubivers LT Std) - the style guide claims they are on google fonts but they are not there as far as I can see - additioanlly self hosting fonts is better for GDPR and page speed.
    What is the functionality of the read More button? is there a transition between states? does it have a hover state? - I will assume the same functionality as the tully read more if not told otherwise when migrated to prod.

Requiremnts :
    container :
        The max width of the content is as per style guide
        The content is split into two asymemtrical columns on desktop and tablet - title left, text right
        The content is contained within a single column on mobile - title top, text bottom
    
    title :
        This will be a h3 tag - the font size and style of a h3 in the style guide is incorrect for this container, therefore I have given it the classes font-large and font-body to make it the given font style of an large body element (see style guide)
        The max width of this container is 420px
        The color of the title is white (#000000)

    copy :
        The copy will be styled as the default body text.
        The container will allow for read more functionality:
            The container shows a variable number of words on different screen sizes.
            If the content has less words than the variable amount for that screen size, the read more button will not show, other wise is will hide the additional copy.
            The button will be bold and read "... Read more" when inactive.
            on click all content will be made visible and the button will read "Read less" and be set to active.
            When clicked in the active state, the content and the button copy will return to the initial sate and return to inactive.
