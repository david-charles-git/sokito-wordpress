While we aim to ensure that all orders are received when expected, delivery to a remote destination is not always guaranteed to arrive within the specified shipping timeframe. This includes circumstances beyond Sokito and our shipping partners control, including customs delays, inaccurate or incomplete shipment information, delivery instructions or information (such as P.O. Box for receiver address, missing or inaccurate receiver telephone number), or receiver’s request for delay, shipment diversion or nonstandard clearance services; or unavailability or refusal of the receiver to accept delivery or to pay duties and taxes against delivery if requested. We work closely with our shipping partners to minimise the potential impact of custom delays for our international customers.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">For the UK, we will endeavour to send all orders the same day if ordered before our cut-off time of 12pm GMT. For European and International destinations our cut-off time is 10am GMT. If ordering after this time, we will endeavour to dispatch your order the next business day. Please note that Sokito will not refund the cost of Next Day UK Delivery if you have selected this option at the checkout after the cut-off time listed above.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">Our processing and delivery times do not include Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. 
														You will be notified once your order has been dispatched, along with a unique tracking number. You may use this tracking number to check on the status of your order at any time by clicking the link provided, or by tracking your order in the ‘My orders’ section of your account.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">Deliveries will be attempted between 9am – 5pm Monday to Friday. If you are not available at the time of delivery, our courier will leave a note at your door with detailed information on how to collect your order. We require a signature for all goods delivered.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">We reserve the right to delay the dispatch of any order. We will contact you as soon as possible if there is a delay or if an item(s) is out of stock.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">We ask that customers inform us of any change with their order as soon as possible by email. If you would like to change an item(s) size, colour or purchase a different item instead, we ask that you cancel your order and repurchase the correct item(s). Orders can be cancelled within 1 hour after they were placed. You can cancel your order by emailing <a href="mailto:ciao@sokito.com" style="color: blue;">ciao@sokito.com.</a> If there is a discrepancy with your shipping address, or you would like to change the destination, we ask that you inform us within 1 hour after receiving order confirmation. Please note that once your order has been dispatched we cannot change the delivery address, and you will therefore be additionally charged for any delivery changes after this time.</p>
														<p class="font_size_18 fw400 lh120 bc ulr mar_top_10px jtext">You will be charged duties and taxes if an item(s) is sent outside of the UK. This is not in our control and is decided by the country we send the item to. The custom costs are the responsibility of the receiver, and must be arranged and paid for by you.
